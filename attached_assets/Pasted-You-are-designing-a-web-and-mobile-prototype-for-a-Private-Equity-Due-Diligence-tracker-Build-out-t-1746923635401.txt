You are designing a web-and-mobile prototype for a Private Equity Due Diligence tracker. Build out the core screens, user roles, and workflows as follows:

1. **User Roles & Permissions**  
   - **Deal Lead** (full access)  
   - **Functional Lead** (Financial, Legal, Ops – can edit tasks in their specialty)  
   - **Partner** (view-only)  

2. **Primary Screens & Navigation**  
   - **Login / SSO** screen (email + password, with “Forgot password?”)  
   - **Dashboard**  
     - Cards showing “Open tasks,” “Overdue items,” “Upcoming deadlines”  
     - Activity feed (“Alice uploaded Q1 financials”)  
   - **Checklist**  
     - List of all due-diligence tasks grouped by phase (LOI, Document Review, Deep Dive, Final Analysis)  
     - Filters for Phase, Category, Status, Owner  
   - **Task Detail**  
     - Fields: Title, Phase, Category, Due Date, Status dropdown, Assigned To, Description  
     - File attachments area (upload/download)  
     - “Log a Request” button that opens a mini-form (Request ID, Notes, Send date)  
   - **Requests & Q&A**  
     - Tabular view of all seller queries, status (“Awaiting response,” “Answered”), link back to parent Task  
   - **RACI Matrix**  
     - Matrix grid with Tasks on rows and R-A-C-I roles on columns; editable person-pickers  
   - **Calendar View**  
     - Monthly calendar showing due dates for all tasks; clicks open Task Detail  
   - **Reports & Analytics**  
     - Simple charts: % complete by phase, list of overdue tasks, workload per lead  

3. **Key Interactions & Flows**  
   - When a user marks a task “Done,” trigger a toast notification (“Task completed”) and update the Dashboard metrics.  
   - Clicking “Log a Request” opens an inline slide-over form.  
   - Drag-and-drop file upload in Task Detail.  
   - Role-based menu – hide edit controls for Partners.  

4. **Styling & Layout**  
   - Responsive web UI with a left sidebar and top nav bar.  
   - Clean, corporate palette (dark blue, slate gray, white), but leave color tokens adjustable.  
   - Use card layouts on Dashboard and Checklist.  

5. **Prototype Mode**  
   - Make all buttons, links, and forms interactive.  
   - Include at least one simulated data set (3–5 sample tasks across 2 phases).

Generate this as a fully clickable prototype in both desktop web and mobile views, complete with active navigation and form modals.
